- My name is Gustavo Poester, I'm an artist, graphic designer, art director, production designer, currently learning software development and living in Buenos Aires (ARG)
- I'm a bachelor in Visual Arts and work eather with drawings and paintings in relatively traditional mediums (oil, charcoal...).
- I love theater, cinema and carpentry! So because of that I also work on shows and performances.
- Recently my interest has shifted towards graphic design and interfaces, so right now I study JavaScript, React and UX design.
- Besides, I'm really into linguistics, I'm fluent in english, portuguease, spanish and french.
- Also, my hobbies are mainly cooking (bakery!) and chess (sicilian ftw). So contact me if you have any questions!
